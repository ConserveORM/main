Conserve 
====
Conserve is a library for storing your Java/Scala/Kotlin objects in a database. It's simple, intuitve, and flexible.
You don't need special mapping files, you don't need a special syntax, you don't need any special annotations - just take your exising plain old objects and chuck them in a database. 

Despite this, Conserve supports advanced search and aggregate functionality. 
Conserve can connect to most major open-source database engines, and is easily extensible.

Conserve also supports Android. Conserve is open source. 

### What is ORM?

Conserve is simpler yet more flexible. Conserve makes it trivial to add persistence to your existing code.
Conserve lets object-oriented searches make sense. Conserve includes compile-time consistency checking.
