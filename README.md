Conserve 
====
Conserve is a library for storing your Java/Scala/Kotlin objects in a database. It's simple, intuitve, and flexible.
You don't need special mapping files, you don't need a special syntax, you don't need any special annotations - just take your exising plain old objects and chuck them in a database. 

Despite this, Conserve supports advanced search and aggregate functionality. 
Conserve can connect to most major open-source database engines, and is easily extensible.

Conserve also supports Android. Conserve is open source. 

### What is ORM?
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) makes it easier to use relational databases from object-oriented programming languages.

### Why Conserve?

* Add persistence to existing objects.
* Persist objects you don't have the source code for, or can't change the source code for.
* Object-oriented searches make sense.
* Compile-time consistency checking.
* Conserve makes it difficult to inadvertently write SQL injection bugs.
* Supports Java Generics.
* Allow customising object representations.
* Search by example.
* Store, search, retrieve arbitrarily complex objects, including objects with deep inheritance hierarchies.
